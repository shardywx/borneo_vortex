Analysis of Borneo vortex structure using an idealised balance approximation tool (Cullen 2018; Fluids). 

This repository contains python code and jupyter notebooks that allow the user to analyse Met Office Unified Model data and calculate diagnostics relevant to the Borneo vortex, a synoptic-scale cyclone that frequently produces extreme rainfall over the Maritime Continent.
